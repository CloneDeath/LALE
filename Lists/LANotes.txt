=Level editing (Dungeons)=
0x28000 - Pointers to rooms (Dungeons 1-6, and some caves). 2 bytes each
0x2C000 - Pointers to rooms (Dungeons 7-9, and rest caves). 2 bytes each
Example: 03 42 = 0x28203

Header = 2 bytes:
1st = Animation index: "set it to different values to control things like water animation and torch and lamp animations." This would make certain tiles animate.
2nd = (Nybble encoded) First 4 bits (0 in 0D) = Wall template (Defining floor and walls). For example, 	$93 = 9 = walls, 3 = floor type
Regular tiles = $00 - $EB
Door tiles = $EC - $FD
	$EC - EF = Key Door
	$F0 - $F3 = Closed door
	$F4 - $F7 = Open door
2 Byte Objects
First byte = Location (YX) (3A = [Y=3][X=A])
Second byte = Tile ID

3 Byte Objects
Always start with 8x or Cx. X = How long it is
8 = Horizontal
C = Vertical
(Follow 2 byte format)

Warps
Each screen can have one warp

5-Byte Warps
First byte = Area Type (E tells it to be a warp, 2 = area type)
	00 = overworld
	01 = dungeon
	02 = side view area
Second byte = Dungeon map (00 = Level 1, 01 = Level 2, etc)
Third byte = Dest Room (Must be in map of the dest dungeon)
Fourth byte = X (Tile x, extra X)
Fifth byte = Y (Add 10, starts at header)

Dungeon Map Minimap:
Each dungeon has 64 (8x8) bytes for the connections. Starts at top left, and goes right. For example:
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 01 00 00 02 03 04 00 00

Starts at 0x50220
00 = No map (null map, enclosed room)
Anything other than 00 is the map ID.

Minimap
The minimap works the same as the connections (Almost)
Side-view maps do not show.
Starts at 0xA49A (ONLY WITH 1.1 ROM)
7D = Empty
EF = Normal Room
EE = Boss
ED = Chest
Room connections start at 0xA71A
Minimap arrow at 0x6E8D
Minimap death locations: 0x50E41

Sprites
Starts at 0x58000. All sprites are placed here.
First data is a list of pointers.
After finding sprite data, it works just like two byte objects (Refer to top)

Tilesets
0x805aa - Wall tile set
0x80589 - Floor tile set

Graphics
Contains no index. 4 bytes per tile, each indicating the 8x8 tiles it's composed of
0x0-0xF - Special Object Graphics
0x10-0x1F - Floor Tiles
0x20-0x3F - Wall Tiles
0x40-7F - Remainder (Chests, stairs, etc...)
0x6C-0x6F - Animated tile graphics, change depending on animation index
0xF0-0xFF - Pots, Blocks, and Statues
Combinations start at: 203b0
Floor graphics start at: 0xB4C00 (4 per tile)

Overworld Editing
Rooms 0-7F - 0x24000
Rooms 80-FF - 0x68000
Overlay data start: 98000 (At 0xCC, data starts at 0x9C000 instead of continuing from room 0xCB)
All overworld pointers are at 0x24000

Overworld Minimap Editing
Graphics 0x0 - 0x6F: 0xB3900
Graphics 0x70 - 0x7F: 0xB3800
Data starts at: 0x81697
Refers to minimap graphic index
Palette starts at: 0x81797

Overworld Palette Pointers: 0x6a476
Overworld sprite sets: 0x830D3 One byte per room
